The TPS65218 Integrated Power Management Chips.
These chips are connected to an i2c bus.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "ti,tps65218";
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC
- interrupt-controller : Since the tps65218 support several interrupts
  internally, it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the SoC.
- #interrupt-cells = <2>;
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional node:
- Child nodes contain in the tps65218.
  It supports a number of features.
  The children nodes will thus depend of the capability of the variant.

Example:
/*
 * Integrated Power Management Chip
 */
tps@24 {
    compatible = "ti,tps65218";
    reg = <0x24>;
    interrupt-controller;
    #interrupt-cells = <2>;
    interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
};
