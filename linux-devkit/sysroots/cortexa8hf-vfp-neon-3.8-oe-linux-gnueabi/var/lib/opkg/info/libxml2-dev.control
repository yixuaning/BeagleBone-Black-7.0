Package: libxml2-dev
Version: 2.9.0-r1.1
Description: XML C Parser Library and Toolkit - Development files
 The XML Parser Library allows for manipulation of XML files.  Libxml2
 exports Push and Pull type parser interfaces for both XML and HTML.  It
 can do DTD validation at parse time, on a parsed document instance or
 with an arbitrary DTD.  Libxml2 includes complete XPath, XPointer and
 Xinclude implementations.  It also has a SAX like interface, which is
 designed to be compatible with Expat.  This package contains symbolic
 links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
