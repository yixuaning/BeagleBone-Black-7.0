<h1> Suspend/Resume </h1>

<h2> This program will put the platform into suspend mode using the pm_suspend.sh script.  The display will blank and the network connection will shutdown.  You can wake the system by sending a key press to the serial console or touching the touchscreen.<br><br>

IMPORTANT NOTE:  For some devices the system requires a key press on the serial console in orer to properly resume.  If the user presses the touchscreen or a button on the EVM, resume will not complete normally and the user will still need to send a key press to the serial console.  This issue will be fixed in a future release.  This has currently been observed on the AM37x device.</h2>
