<h1> Thermostat Demo </h1>

<p>This example demonstrates a simple GUI to implement thermostat feature</p>

<p>In order to receive current weather conditions and forecast data the EVM must be connected to the internet. Proxy settings can be configured under the Network tab of the Settings page within the application. If no connection is present, sample data will be generated.</p>

<p>To use the remote configuration feature of this application, use a web browser and type in the address of the EVM followed by port 8081, i.e. http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8081/, to access the temperature control and weather data.</p>

<p>NOTE: The ip address of the EVM can be found by either using the "ifconfig" command on the serial console, or by running the Settings -> Network Settings application in Matrix<h2>
