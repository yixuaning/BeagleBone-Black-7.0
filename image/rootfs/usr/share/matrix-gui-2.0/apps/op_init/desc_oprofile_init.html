<h1> Oprofile Initialization </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> To use Oprofile, you need to tell oprofile where vmlinux 
corresponding to the kernel is located 
</p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
<p> This will allow you to profile the kernel along with your application.
If you don't want to profile the kernel: opcontrol --no--vmlinux
</p>
<p> This only needs to be done one time. </p>
<p> To run from the command line:
</p>
<p> root@device:~# opcontrol --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux-[kernel version]
</p>
