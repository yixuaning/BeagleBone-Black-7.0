<h1> Enable eth1 to eth 0 nat  </h1>

<h2>Warning: This demo requires the second Ethernet port and the second Ethernet port (eth1) can only be enabled on the AM335x EVM-SK board.</h2>

<p> This demo will enable the second ethernet port (eth1) and setup a nat to eth0 from eth1. To test plug in a laptop to connector J7 and try to ping a device connected through eth0. You can use the network info icon to see the ip addresses for both ports.</p>

<p> NOTE: Do not place both the ethernet ports on the same subnet, this connection method is not supported. </p>
